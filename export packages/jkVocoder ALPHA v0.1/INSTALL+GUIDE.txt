To use this max 4 live patch, you will likely have to transfer the vocalc.mxo file into your user's Max folder (/Users/YOUR_USERNAME/Documents/Max 8/Library).
After that, the vocoder .amxd file should be able to be dragged and dropped into ableton as with any max 4 live plugin.

PLEASE NOTE:
 - This plugin sounds FANTASTIC when you turn the bandwidth to very low amounts (i.e. below 3.0%)-it almost becomes a resonator.
 - The attack and release are...misbehaving, for lack of a better word. If the plugin sounds too quiet, try messing around with them.
 - The design for this plugin was heavily reliant on the tutorial found at this link: https://cycling74.com/tutorials/a-basic-vocoder-tutorial-part-1
